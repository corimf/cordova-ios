+- Full description: Using the built-in webview navigator.geolocation requires a
+new key added to the info.plist file for iOS 8. This is just added in the
+plugin.xml file for geolocation and the issue is resolved. For the Cordova
+Geolocation plugin, the issue requires the change above plus a change to the
+CDVLocation.m file in the plugin. The iOS8 SDK changed the API for requesting
+permission to access location. Therefore, changes had to be made on the
+native side to account for that.
